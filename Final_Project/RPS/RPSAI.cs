    /* This is the class for the AI that will play the rock paper scissors game.
   * The way that the AI will work is that it will have an array with the integer
   *  values between 0 and 2.
   *  
   *  0: represents rock
   *  1: represents paper
   *  2: represents scissors
   *  
   *  When a user clicks a button to select either rock paper or scissors the AI
   *  will then randomly select an index from the array and play whatever is in the 
   *  index. If the AI loses then it will replace the number in the cell with the
   *  number that would have won that round.
   *  
   *  The idea is that there will be a move that is played more often than the rest
   *  and most of the array spots will get filled with the winning moves. To achieve
   *  this the array will be serializeable to keep track of the previous learning.
